# Performance Enhancement of Non-Intrusive Load Monitoring Based on Adaptive Multiscale Attention Integration Module
Abstractâ€” In light of the increasing global energy demands and growing environmental awareness, the responsible management of energy consumption has become a crucial issue in today's world. Non-intrusive load monitoring (NILM) plays a pivotal role in facilitating intelligent electricity consumption and energy conservation management. Addressing the challenge faced by current NILM approaches in accurately identifying electrical appliances with similar signatures and minute load variations under noisy conditions, this research introduces a novel deep learning framework for non-intrusive load monitoring known as the AMSAIM-NILM model. This model amalgamates the dynamic receptive field adjustment capabilities of selective kernel (SK) units with the efficient multi-scale attention mechanisms of the efficient multi-scale attention (EMA) module, thereby enhancing the model's adaptability and processing capabilities across various scales of information. Our experiments, conducted using the benchmark UK-DALE dataset, demonstrate that the AMSAIM-NILM model surpasses existing methodologies in both accuracy and F1 scores, particularly in scenarios requiring fine-grained load detection. The results of our experimental validation confirm that the AMSAIM-NILM model significantly improves identification efficiency and offers superior accuracy and robustness when dealing with the temporal patterns of various appliance loads compared to existing methods.
